You can determine what version of R you have by starting up R and typing into the console R.version.string and hitting the return/enter key. If you do not have the proper version of R installed, go to CRAN and download and install the latest version.\nSome students like to use the Rstudio interface, but this is optional, and in fact discouraged until you have a grasp of the R environment (I will let you know when we are at a good place in the course). The RStudio interactive development environment (IDE) requires that R be installed, and so is an “add-on” to R. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop for free from the RStudio web site. You can determine the version of RStudio by looking at menu item Help &gt; About RStudio. You should be using RStudio version 1.4.1106 or higher."

Projects will be submitted electronically via GitHub (more on this later).\nThe projects are basically a scaffold to learn how to build a data analysis pipeline for your own research data. If you donʻt have your own data yet, I encourage students to ask their advisor for a sample dataset, or a published dataset, or another grad studentʻs dataset to practice on. You can also ask me for help to find data, this is not a problem.\nProject 0 is actually optional, but you are encouraged to practice by putting up your own website. Project 1 is data cleaning on a sample dataset, Project 2 produces analyses on the cleaned data from Project 1. Project 3 is applying everything you learned to your own dataset and exploring. You will also do a show-and-tell oral presentation on Project 3 at the end of the semester. Itʻs fun and students learn a lot. Itʻs exciting to see everyone elseʻs stuff and the diversity of projects people do.\nThe project assignments will be due on\n\nProject 0: February 4, 11:59pm (optional and not graded but hopefully useful and fun)\nProject 1: February 27, 11:59pm\nProject 2: March 25, 11:59pm\nProject 3: April 7-May 6 (multiple stages)\n\nCollaboration\nPlease feel free to study together and talk to one another about project assignments. The mutual instruction that students give each other is among the most valuable that can be achieved.\nHowever, it is expected that project assignments will be implemented and written up independently unless otherwise specified. Specifically, please do not share analytic code or output. Please do not collaborate on write-up and interpretation.

This is entirely left up to the discretion of the student.\nLate days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason no questions asked.\nYou do not get any bonus points for not using your late days, and they are not transferrable.\n\nFor students who exceed their free late days:\n\nI will be deducting 5% for each extra late day. For example, if you have already used all of your late days for the term, we will deduct 5% for the assignment that is &lt;24 hours late, 10% points for the assignment that is 24-48 hours late, and 15% points for the assignment that is 48-72 hours late, etc.\n\nI will not grade assignments that are more than 3 days past the original due date.\n\nRegrading Policy\nIt is very important to me that all assignments are properly graded. If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please send an email within 7 days of receiving the grade explaining the issue. No re-grade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 7 days after you receive the grade for the assignment."

    "text": "Prerequisites\nThis is an applied quantitative course. I will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking is useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R, especially at the very beginning (but it will get better). As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to do well, independent of your background. In fact you will have the most to gain.\nGetting set up\nYou must install R and RStudio, optional on your computer in order to complete this course. These are two different applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\nR is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\nRStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux.

    "text": "git\nGit is software that implements what is called a version control system for a repository of files (also known as a repo). The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the git software tracks, and records any changes made by anyone.\nGitHub is an online server and user interface that provides powerful tools for distribution of your repository, bug tracking, collaboration, and also allows you to create easy websites for each repository.\nGit and GitHub together provide an organized way to track your projects, and all of the tools you will need in this course are free.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Whether working solo (A) or collaborating in a group (B) version tracking by naming files is a mess when you want to retrace the steps of the analysis (C). Git and GitHub track all changes and the complete branching tree of the project (D). The commit history is a powerful tool to retrace the development of the project or can be used to roll back to any prior version.\n\n\n\n[Source: Jenny Bryan]\nIt is very well suited for collaborative work, as it was developed by Linus Torvalds (in about 10 days of coding!) for collaborative software development of the Linux kernel pretty interesting interview with Torvalds. What it did really well was distributed control, and allowing everyone to have their own copy of the repository.\nGit/GitHub is now the dominant version control system with GitHub hosting over 200 million repositories worldwide! It is used very broadly for all kinds of repos now including data science projects, book projects, courses, and anything that needs collaborative management of mostly text files.\nAnother great and fun read about Git/GitHub and why it is a great tool for data analysis is in this article by Jenny Bryan."

    "text": "What to (not) use Git/GitHub for\nGitHub is ideal if you have a project with (possibly many) smallish files, and most of those files are text files (such as R code, LaTeX, Quarto/(R)Markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.\nGitHub is less useful if you have a lot of non-text files (e.g. Word or PowerPoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.\nGitHub also has a problem with large files. Anything above around 50MB can lead to very slow syncing and sometimes outright failure. Unfortunately, once GitHub has choked on a large file, it can be quite tricky to fix the repository to work again. This is because the ENTIRE history is saved, including the addition of the huge file. Therefore keep large (&gt;50MB) files out of your GitHub repositories. If you have to work with such files, try to reduce them first before placing into the GitHub repository. Or as alternative, place those files in another sync service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive) and load them from there.\nFinally, if you have data, you need to be careful since by default, GitHub repositories are public. You can set the repository to private, but you need to be careful that you don’t accidentally expose confidential data to the public. It is in general not a good idea to have confidential data on GitHub. First anonymize your data (ensure that it is not at risk of identifiability), then you can place it in a private repository. If you put it in a public repo, be very careful!! (And you may need IRB approval, check with your institutional research office.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nGit/GitHub has version control features like a turbo-charged version of “track changes” but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files\nGreat for solo or collaborative work\nSaves the entire history of every change made\nAllows for multiple verisions or “branches” to be developed and later merged\nGitHub allows distributed collaboration (potentially among complete strangers) and has greatly promoted open-source software development, collaboration, distribution, and bug/issue tracking for users to get help\nGitHub allows webpages for your projects or repositories\n\n\n\nNote that other interfaces to Git exist, e.g., Bitbucket, but GitHub is the most widely used one."

After all, isnʻt that what the methods section is for? We are taught to write methods sections so that any scientist could, in theory, repeat the experiment with the idea that if the phenomenon is true, they should obtain comparable results and more often than not should come to the same conclusions.\nBut how repeatable is modern science? Many experiments are now so complex and so expensive that repeating them is not practical. However, it is even worse than that. As datasets get larger and analyses become ever more complex, there is a growing concern that even given the data, we still cannot necessarily repeat the analysis. This is called “the reproducbility crisis”.\nRecently, there has been a lot of discussion of reproducibility in the media and in the scientific literature. The journal Science had a special issue on reproducibility and data replication.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/toc/science/334/6060\n\nTake for example a recent study by the Crowdsourced Replication Initiative (2022). It was a massive effort by 166 coauthors published in PNAS to test repeatability:\n\n73 research teams from around the world analyzed the same social science data.\nThey investigated the same hypothesis: that more immigration will reduce public support for government provision of social policies.\nTogether they fit 1261 statistical models and came to widely varying concluisons.\nA meta-analysis of the results by the PIs could not explain the variation in results. Even after accounting for the choices made by the research teams in designing their statistical tests, 95% of the total variation remained unexplained.\nThe authors claim that “a hidden universe of uncertainty remains.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Breznau et al., 2022\nThis should be very disturbing. It was very disturbing to me! Greyer notes that the meta-analysis did not investigate how much of the variability of results was due to outright error. He furthermore notes that while the meta-analysis was done in a reproducibly, the original 73 analyses were not. What does he mean?\nSome of the issues from a statisticianʻs perspective\nGreyer provides nine ideas worth considering:\n\nMost scientific papers that need statistics have conclusions that are not actually supported by the statistical calculations done, because of\n\nmathematical or computational error,\nstatistical procedures inappropriate for the data, or\nstatistical procedures that do not lead to the inferences claimed.\n\n\nGood computing practices — version control, well thought out testing, code reviews, literate programming — are essential to correct computing.\nFailure to do all calculations from raw data to conclusions (every number or figure shown in a paper) in a way that is fully reproducible and available in a permanent public repository is, by itself, a questionable research practice.\nFailure to do statistics as if it could have been pre-registered is a questionable research practice.\nJournals that use P &lt; 0.05 as a criterion of publication are not scientific journals (publishing only one side of a story is as unscientific as it is possible to be).\nStatistics should be adequately described, at least in the supplementary material.\nScientific papers whose conclusions depend on nontrivial statistics should have statistical referees, and those referees should be heeded.\nNot all errors are describable by statistics. There is also what physicists call systematic error that is the same in every replication of an experiment. Physicists regularly attempt to quantify this. Others should too.\n\nA reasonable ideal for reproducible research today - Research should be reproducible. Anything in a scientific paper should be reproducible by the reader. - Whatever may have been the case in low tech days, this ideal has long gone. Much scientific research in recent years is too complicated and the published details to scanty for anyone to reproduce it. - The lack of detail is not entirely the author’s fault. Journals have severe page pressure and no room for full explanations. - For many years, the only hope of reproducibility is old-fashioned person-to-person contact. Write the authors, ask for data, code, whatever. Some authors help, some don’t. If the authors are not cooperative, tough. - Even cooperative authors may be unable to help. If too much time has gone by and their archiving was not systematic enough and if their software was unportable, there may be no way to recreate the analysis. - Fortunately, the internet comes to the rescue. No page pressure there! - Nowadays, many scientific papers also point to supplementary materials on the internet. Data, computer programs, whatever should be there, permanently. Ideally with a permanent Document Identifier or DOI. There are complaints that many Supplmentary Materials are incomprehensible, but that can be improved with practices of reproducible reserach.\nTherefore, at the very least scientists should use in their statistical programming - version control, - software testing, - code reviews, - literate programming, and - all data and code available in a permanent public repository.\nSome journals have specific policies to promote reproducibility in manuscripts that are published in their journals. For example, the Journal of American Statistical Association (JASA) requires authors to submit their code and data to reproduce their analyses and a set of Associate Editors of Reproducibility review those materials as part of the review process:\n\nhttps://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide\nRecommendations\nDiscuss Table 1\nAuthors and Readers\nIt is important to realize that there are multiple players when you talk about reproducibility–there are different types of parties that have different types of interests. There are authors who produce research and they want to make their research reproducible. There are also readers of research and they want to reproduce that work. Everyone needs tools to make their lives easier.\nOne current challenge is that authors of research have to undergo considerable effort to make their results available to a wide audience.\n\nPublishing data and code today is not necessarily a trivial task. Although there are a number of resources available now, that were not available even five years ago, it is still a bit of a challenge to get things out on the web (or at least distributed widely).\nResources like GitHub, kipoi, and RPubs and various data repositories have made a big difference, but there is still a ways to go with respect to building up the public reproducibility infrastructure.\n\nFurthermore, even when data and code are available, readers often have to download the data, download the code, and then they have to piece everything together, usually by hand. It’s not always an easy task to put the data and code together.\n\nReaders may not have the same computational resources that the original authors did.\nIf the original authors used an enormous computing cluster, for example, to do their analysis, the readers may not have that same enormous computing cluster at their disposal. It may be difficult for readers to reproduce the same results.\n\nGenerally, the toolbox for doing reproducible research is small, although it’s definitely growing.\n\nIn practice, authors often just throw things up on the web. There are journals and supplementary materials, but they are famously disorganized.\nThere are only a few central databases that authors can take advantage of to post their data and make it available. So if you are working in a field that has a central database that everyone uses, that is great. If you are not, then you have to assemble your own resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nThe process of conducting and disseminating research can be depicted as a “data science pipeline”\nReaders and consumers of data science research are typically not privy to the details of the data science pipeline\nOne view of reproducibility is that it gives research consumers partial access to the raw pipeline elements.\n\n\n\nPost-lecture materials\nFinal Questions\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhy can replication be difficult to achieve? Why is reproducibility a reasonable minimum standard when replication is not possible?\nWhat is needed to reproduce the results of a data analysis?\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducible Research: A Retrospective by Roger Peng and Stephanie Hicks"

This helps when you are writing text documents across folders. So for example if you have your Rclass folder in one place and your website folder in another, you can have both open within the Sublime project. When you finish working on it you can save the project and reopen it later.\nTo create a project start by opening a new file. Then choose the Project &gt; Add folder to Project... on the menu bar. You can load mulitple folders.\nIt has contextual highlighting for Quarto as well as GitHub markdown.\nIt also has integration with command line R https://bishwarup-paul.medium.com/a-guide-to-using-r-in-sublime-text-27f78b33f872.

    "text": "Organize your Projects into Folders\nWeʻve been learning about reproducibility. One important aspect is file organization. Each project should be organized into one folder that contains:\n\nAll input data (usually in a Data folder)\nAll code and documentation\nAll output\n\nThe idea is to keep everything complete, self-contained, and clear. Move old versions into a “Trash” folder. If you donʻt end up looking back at it, then delete it! (Or if you are bold, delete it right away!)\nA really useful UNIX/CMD command is tree. It shows you the directory structure contained within any folder. It works on both MacOS and Windows.\nThis is in ASCII – so you can copy and paste it into your README.md file!\n\n\nTerminal/CMD\n\ntree myfolder\n\nIf it is not pre-installed on your mac, you may need to install it with homebrew:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nbrew install tree"

Take, for example, the file format generated from our hand-held Ocean Optics specroradiometer. It is very regular in structure, and we have tons of data files, so it is well worth the programming effort to code a script for automatic file input.\nFirst, you can open the file below in a text editor. If you’d rather open it in R, you can use:\n\nreadLines(\"20070725_01forirr.txt\")\n\nNotice that there is a very large header, in fact the first 17 lines. Notice also that the last line will cause a problem. Also, the delimiter in this file is tab (backslash t).\n\ntemp &lt;- readLines(\"20070725_01forirr.txt\")\nhead(temp)\ntail(temp)\n\nWe can solve these issues using the skip and the comment.char arguments of read.table to ignore both types of lines, reading in only the “good stuff”. Also, the default delimiter in this function is the tab:\n\ndat &lt;- read.table(file=\"20070725_01forirr.txt\", skip=17, comment.char=\"&gt;\")\nnames(dat) &lt;- c(\"lambda\", \"intensity\")\nhead(dat)\n\n  lambda intensity\n1 177.33         0\n2 177.55         0\n3 177.77         0\n4 177.99         0\n5 178.21         0\n6 178.43         0\n\ntail(dat)\n\n     lambda intensity\n3643 888.21   0.29491\n3644 888.38   0.31306\n3645 888.54   0.28153\n3646 888.71   0.28245\n3647 888.87   0.18988\n3648 889.04   0.18988\n\n\nThe file produces (useless) rows of data outside of the range of accuracy of the spectraradiometer. We can get rid of these by subsetting the data, selecting only the range 300-750nm:\n\ndat &lt;- dat[dat$lambda &gt;= 300, ]  # cut off rows below 300nm\ndat &lt;- dat[dat$lambda &lt;= 750, ]  #cut off rows above 750nm\n\nOr do both at once:\n\ndat &lt;- dat[dat$lambda &gt;= 300 & dat$lambda &lt;= 750,]\n\nIf we are going to be doing this subsetting over and over, we might want to save this as an index vector which tells us the position of the rows of data we want to keep in the dataframe (don’t worry, we’ll cover this again in the workhorse functions chapter).\n\noo &lt;- dat$lambda &gt;= 300 & dat$lambda &lt;= 750\ndat &lt;- dat[oo, ]   # same as longer version above\n\nWe can now save the cleaned up version of the irradiance data:\n\nwrite.csv(dat, \"20070725_01forirr.csv\")"

    "text": "Human Error\nIt is very easy to make a typo, and humans are really bad at catching our own typos in real time. Right? They creep in despite our best efforts. This is why even though it is possible to measure specimens and enter the numbers directly into the computer, itʻs not something I would do.\nI always write my measurements down into a notebook or a datasheet using pencil and paper. This has saved me many errors in three ways (1) sometimes my brain is still processing what I just wrote and I will catch a typo. (2) I write my data in rows for specimens and columns for the different measurements. As the dataset builds, it is easy to notice errors if some number is really off. (3) If you have any doubts, you can quickly look over your page and re-measure anything suspicous. If you have the person-power, you can also have one person taking the measurements and calling them out, and another writing them down and repeating them back. It is a very effective way to check on the spot.\nI had my first post-college job at an insurance rating board. This is a business that deals with reams and reams of data. We did work a lot with Fortran code and spreadsheets, but surprisingly, some of it does actually have to get manually checked. The protocol was simple, a paper printout of the old version was put next to the new version and a person went along with a ruler, literally putting a check mark after verifying the number. A second check was done as well, and then I finally understood the meaning of “double checking” 😝. When I got to grad school, it was eye-opening to find that checking any personʻs data entry was a rare practice 😲. Please, whenever possible check your data entry. So here are some tips:\n\nRecord data in a notebook (paper and pencil). It serves as a permanent record.\nWrite it down in a data table format in an order that minimizes error. For example, if it is convenient to take five measurements in a particular order, then organize your table that way and always take the measurements in the same order.\nOrganize your spreadsheet to mirror the hand-written data. This will minimize data entry errors.\nHave another person check your data entry against the notebook."

Below is a summary of the recommendations made in paper by Karl Broman and Kara Woo (Broman and Woo 2018).\n\n\nBe Consistent - Have a plan before you start entering data. Be consistent and stick to it.\n\nChoose Good Names for Things - You want the names you pick for objects, files, and directories to be memorable, easy to spell, descriptive, but concise. This is actually a hard balance to achieve and it does require time and thought.\n\nOne important rule to follow is do not use spaces, use underscores _ or dashes instead -.\nAlso, avoid symbols; stick to letters and numbers.\n\n\n\nWrite Dates as YYYY-MM-DD - To avoid confusion, we strongly recommend using this global ISO 8601 standard.\n\nNo Empty Cells - Fill in all cells and use some common code for missing data.\n\nPut Just One Thing in a Cell - It is better to add columns to store the extra information rather than having more than one piece of information in one cell.\n\nMake It a Rectangle - The spreadsheet should be a rectangle.\n\nCreate a Data Dictionary - If you need to explain things, such as what the columns are or what the labels used for categorical variables are, do this in a separate file. This is an excellent use for a README.md file\n\nNo Calculations in the Raw Data Files - Excel permits you to perform calculations. Do not make this part of your spreadsheet. Code for calculations should be in a script.\n\nDo Not Use Font Color or Highlighting as Data - Most import functions are not able to import this information. Encode this information as a variable (a “comment” column) instead.\n\nMake Backups - Make regular backups of your data.\n\nUse Data Validation to Avoid Errors - Leverage the tools in your spreadsheet software so that the process is as error-free and repetitive-stress-injury-free as possible. Think of checks you can do for “reality checks”.\n\nSave the Data as Text Files - Save files for sharing in comma or tab delimited format. An unambiguous text format is the best for archiving your data."

    "text": "Text versus binary files\nFor data science purposes, files can generally be classified into two categories: text files (also known as ASCII files) and binary files. You have already worked with text files. All your R scripts are text files and so are the Quarto files used to create this website. The .csv tables you have read are also text files. One big advantage of these files is that we can easily “look” at them using a plain text editor, without having to purchase any kind of special software.\nAny text editor can be used to examine a text file, including freely available editors such as R, RStudio, Atom, Notepad, TextEdit, vi, emacs, nano, and pico. However, if you try to open, say, an Excel xls file, jpg or png file, you will not be able to see anything immediately useful. These are binary files. Excel files are actually compressed folders with several text files inside. But the main distinction here is that text files can be easily examined.\nAlthough R includes tools for reading widely used binary files, such as xls files, in general you will want to find data sets stored in text files. If necessary, use the proprietary software to export the data into text files and go from there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe problem with using propietary formats for data management is that htey are poor formats for achival purposes. These formats may change or they donʻt copy well, so that eventually you can no longer open them.\n\n\nSimilarly, when sharing data you want to make it available as text files as long as storage is not an issue (binary files are much more efficient at saving space on your disk). In general, plain-text formats make it easier to share data since commercial software is not required for working with the data, and they are more reliable.\nTechnically, html and xml files are text files too, but they have complicated tags around the information. In the Data Wrangling part of the book we learn to extract data from more complex text files such as html files."

    "text": "Unicode versus ASCII\nA pitfall in data science is assuming a file is an ASCII text file when, in fact, it is something else that can look a lot like an ASCII text file, for example, a Unicode text file.\nTo understand the difference between these, remember that everything on a computer needs to eventually be converted to 0s and 1s (binary format). ASCII is an encoding that maps bits to characters that are easier for humans to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinary data can take on only two values - 0 or 1\n\n\n\n\na bit is the smallest unit, a single binary character (0 or 1).\na byte is eight bits.\na megabyte or MB is one million bytes.\na gigabyte or GB is one billion bytes.\nYou can roughly calculate the size of your data by the numbers of bytes per each observation.\n\n\n\nASCII uses 7 bits – seven variables that can be either 0 or 1 – which results in 27 = 128 unique items, enough to encode all the characters on an English language keyboard (all characters, numbers, and symbols, Figure 1, Figure 2). However, we need to expand the possibilities if we want to include support for other languages or additional characters.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Binary encodings in ACII, with some of the most used escape sequences like \\t for tab and \\n for new line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Some examples of ASCII encodings for A-E and a-e.\n\n\nFor this reason, a new encoding, using more than 7 bits, was defined: Unicode. When using Unicode, one can chose between 8, 16, and 32 bits abbreviated UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 respectively. RStudio actually defaults to UTF-8 encoding.\nAlthough we do not go into the details of how to deal with the different encodings here, it is important that you know these different encodings exist so that you can better diagnose a problem if you encounter it. One way problems manifest themselves is when you see “weird looking” characters you were not expecting.\nMany plain text editors (Atom, Sublime, TextWrangler, Notepad++) will detect encodings and tell you what they are and may also convert between them. Also from the command line the file command will reveal the encoding (should also work on Windows if you have git installed:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nfile filename\n\nThis StackOverflow discussion is an example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18789330/r-on-windows-character-encoding-hell."

The line ending is the invisible (to us) character that is added to your file when you press the return key.\nIt is all one stream of informatin to the computer, but the computer will interpret the information as a new line when it detects one of these characters. When software is provided a file with an unexpected line ending, it is not able to properly detect the lines of information (maybe it sees only one huge line). See?\nThere are two types of line endings in use today:\n\nOn UNIX and MacOS, text file line-endings are terminated with a newline character (ASCII 0x0a, represented by the \\n escape sequence in most languages), also referred to as a linefeed (LF).\nOn Windows, line-endings are terminated with a combination of a carriage return (ASCII 0x0d or \\r) and a newline(\\n), also referred to as CR/LF.\n\nIf your computer complains about line endings, the easiest thing to do is to open it in one of the good plain text editors and save it with the line endings it is expecting (usually as LF instead of CR/LF)."

It is important that you are comfortable using the Command Line Interface as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons to be proficient in the shell:\n\n\n\n\nData analysis increasingly uses many files. The shell provides a simple but very powerful means to do all kinds of operations on files: move, delete, organize, combine, rename, etc.\nUsing the shell encourages you to understand your computerʻs filesystem, and helps you to more precisely control input and output to any place along your file paths.\nShell operations are fast.\nYou can use wildcards to control matching or excluding many files.\nThe shell can be used to execute (run) software.\nThe shell is probably the oldest app, so it is very stable with lasting power.\nIt is part of the OS, so when your apps fail or you are having some issues, you would turn to the shell to kill troublesome processes (programs) or diagnose and fix the issues.\n\n\n\nMacs use the same terminal utilities as UNIX/Linux systems.

    "text": "Sweave and \\(\\LaTeX\\)\n\nThe first literate programming system for R is called Sweave. sweave enables users to combine R code with a typesetting language called \\(\\LaTeX\\).\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) markup specifies how the text, mathematical equations, tables, and figures will be formatted, allowing the separation of content from formatting (as opposed to WYSYWIG word processors like Word or Google Docs).\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) is very powerful for:\n\nLaying out mathematical equations. This is its superpower!\n\nFine-tuned control of formatting (all kinds!)\nPowerful tools for integrating citations via BibTEX and cross-references to Figures, Tables, Equations, Sections, anything you wish to label.\n\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) was written by Leslie Lamport when he was at the Stanford Research Institute, as a set of macros for \\(\\TeX\\), which is the underlying typesetting engine written by Donald Knuth. Lamport wanted to write a book using \\(\\TeX\\), so he wrote the \\(\\LaTeX\\) macros and a manual, which made it easier for many others to use \\(\\TeX\\).\nBefore sweave, one would write code to perform statistical analysis or modeling in R, and the manuscript in latex once the coding was complete. As projects develop, however, keeping these processes separate can lead to a lack of reproducibility.\nsweave revolutionized coding, and has become part of the R base code. sweave was written by Friedrich Leisch, who is on the R Core Development Team and the BioConductor Project. To see an example of LaTeX see [small2e.tex] and for Sweave, check out [Little_Sweave.Rnw].\nSweave files have a .Rnw file ending and have R code weaved through the document, interspered with :\n&lt;&lt;plot1, height=4, width=5, eval=FALSE&gt;&gt;=\ndata(airquality)\nplot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)\n@\nOnce you have created your .Rnw file containing code chunks for your R code, and \\(\\LaTeX\\) tags to format your text, from your R console you run the sweave() function to weave the file, executing the R chunks and replacing them with output as appropriate to typeset before creating the PDF document.\nSweaveʻs main limitation is that it requires knowledge of \\(\\LaTeX\\), which has a steep learning curve.\n\nSweave also lacks a lot of features that people find useful like caching, and multiple plots per page and mixing programming languages.\nFor developers, Sweave is hard to extend with new functions.\n\nInspired by Sweave, Yihui Xie wrote knitr to extend literate programming capabilities in R even further by combining features of other add on packages into one package. It adds richer graphics features and importantly extends use of much simpler Markdown documents to take advantage of LaTeX without having to write it!"

    "text": "rmarkdown\nMarkdown is a much simpler document language. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md. The rmarkdown R package takes a R Markdown file (.Rmd) and weaves together R code chunks Figure 1, which can be output in a variety of different possible formats.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: R markdown can be used to translate text and code into many different output formats\n\n\nR chunks surrounded by text looks like this:\n```{r plot1, height=4, width=5, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}\ndata(airquality)\nplot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe best resource for learning about R Markdown this the book by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund:\n\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown\n\nThe R Markdown Cookbook by Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer is really good too:\n\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook\n\nThe authors describe the motivation for the 2nd book as:\n\n“However, we have received comments from our readers and publisher that it would be beneficial to provide more practical and relatively short examples to show the interesting and useful usage of R Markdown, because it can be daunting to find out how to achieve a certain task from the aforementioned reference book (put another way, that book is too dry to read). As a result, this cookbook was born.”\n\n\n\nBecause this is lecture is built using a .qmd file (which is very similar to a .Rmd file), let’s demonstrate how this works. I am going to change eval=FALSE to eval=TRUE.\n\ndata(airquality)\nplot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we not see the back ticks ``` anymore in the code chunk above that made the plot?\nWhat do you think we should do if we want to have the code executed, but we want to hide the code that made it?\n\n\n\nBefore we leave this section, I find that there is quite a bit of terminology to understand the magic behind rmarkdown that can be confusing, so let’s break it down:\n\n\nPandoc. Pandoc is a command line tool with no GUI that converts documents (e.g. from number of different markup formats to many other formats, such as .doc, .pdf etc). It is completely independent from R (but does come bundled with RStudio). If you donʻt have Rstudio installed, you will have to install pandoc.\n\nMarkdown (markup language). Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md. It is completely independent from R.\nR Markdown (markup language). R Markdown is an extension of the markdown syntax for weaving together text with R code. R Markdown files are plain text files that typically have the file extension .Rmd.\n\nrmarkdown (R package). The R package rmarkdown is a library that uses pandoc to process and convert text and R code written in .Rmd files into a number of different formats. This core function is rmarkdown::render(). Note: this package only deals with the markdown language. If the input file is e.g. .Rhtml or .Rnw, then you need to use knitr prior to calling pandoc (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCheck out the R Markdown Quick Tour for more:\n\nhttps://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst on RMarkdown\n\nknitr\nOne of the alternative that has come up in recent times is something called knitr.\n\nThe knitr package for R takes a lot of these ideas of literate programming and updates and improves upon them.\n\nknitr still uses R as its programming language, but it allows you to mix other programming languages in.\n\nknitr is included in the installation of rmarkdown.\nYou can also use a variety of documentation languages now, such as \\(\\LaTeX\\) , markdown and HTML.\n\nknitr was developed by Yihui Xie while he was a graduate student at Iowa State and it has become a very popular package for writing literate statistical programs.\n\nKnitr takes a plain text document with embedded code, executes the code and ‘knits’ the results back into the document.\nFor for example, it converts\n\nAn R Markdown (.Rmd) file into a standard markdown file (.md)\nAn .Rnw (Sweave) file into to .tex format.\nAn .Rhtml file into to .html.\n\nThe core function is knitr::knit() and by default this will look at the input document and try and guess what type it is e.g. Rnw, Rmd etc.\nThis core function performs three roles:\n\nA source parser, which looks at the input document and detects which parts are code that the user wants to be evaluated.\nA code evaluator, which evaluates this code\nAn output renderer, which writes the results of evaluation back to the document in a format which is interpretable by the raw output type. For instance, if the input file is an .Rmd, the output render marks up the output of code evaluation in .md format.\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting a Rmd file to many outputs using knitr and pandoc\n\n\n\n[Source]\nAs seen in the figure above, from there pandoc is used to convert e.g. a .md file into many other types of file formats into a .html, etc.\nSo in summary:\n\n“R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).”\n\n[Source]"

    "text": "Create your website locally with Quarto\nIn this section, I am adding a bit more explanation to the Quarto quickstart guide up to and including Render. If something is not clear, please consult https://quarto.org/docs/websites/\nThere are three main quarto commands we will use:\n\n\nquarto create-project: Make a website project template\n\nquarto preview: Take a look at what the webite will look like\n\nquarto render: Render your qmd to html\n\n\nMake your website directory and template\nCreate your website (here called mysite) using the following command. It will make a directory of the same name and put the website contents within it.\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto create-project mysite --type website\n\nYou should now see the following files in your mysite directory (Figure 2):\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Website files from the Terminal view\n\n\nThis is the bare-bones version of your website. Check that the code is functional by looking at a preview:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto preview\n\nThis should open up a browser window showing a temporary file made by quarto by rendering your website files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nquarto preview will refresh the preview every time you save your index.qmd (or any) website files. So itʻs a good idea to keep the preview open as you make edits and saves.\nCheck every edit, it is easier to debug in small steps.\nTerminate quarto preview with Control-c\n\n\n\n\nRender your website to html\nUse quarto to render your content to html, the format used by browsers. First navigate into your website directory then render:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ncd mysite\nquarto render\n\nTake a look at the mysite contents after rendering, you should see a new directory _site (Figure 3). The html was rendered and put in there (go ahead, open up the files and check it out):\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Website files after rendering\n\n\nPersonalize your content\nWhat is really nice is that you can personalize your website by simply editing the quarto markdown and yaml files.\nWeb content goes in .qmd\n\nUsing any text editor, edit the index.qmd to personalize your website.\nThe first section of your index.qmd is the header. You can change the title and add additional header information, including any cover images and website templates.\nFor example this is what I have in my course website index.qmd header. Note that my cover image is in a folder called images within at the top level of my website directory. If you want to try this out substitute or remove the image line and change the twitter/github handles.\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Welcome to Introduction to Data Science in R for Biologists!\"\nimage: images/mycoolimage.png\nabout:\n  template: jolla\n  links:\n    - icon: twitter\n      text: Twitter\n      href: https://twitter.com/mbutler808\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: https://github.com/mbutler808\n---\n\nYou should edit the body of your website as well. You simply edit the text.\nThe quarto markdown page has great examples showing how to format your content. Take a look at how to specify header sizes, lists, figures and tables. You might want to bookmark this page!\nTry editing the about.qmd file as well. You will notice that this is another tab in your website. YOu can add more tabs by adding .qmd files.\nWith each addition, be sure to quarto preview your changes to make sure it works. When you are satisfied with your website, quarto render to render to html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWhen editing markdown, take care to note spaces and indents as they are interpreted for formatting.\nIndentations are really important for formatting lists.\nFor example in a hyperlink, there is no space between the square brackets and parentheses. [This is a cool link](http://mycoollink.com)\n\n\n\n\nWebsite-wide settings go in _quarto.yml\n\nAll Quarto projects include a _quarto.yml configuration file that sets the global options that apply across the entire website.\nYAML started off as “Yet Another Markup Language” 😜. It is clean, clear, and widely used. You can edit your YAML to add options or change the format of your website. Take a look at your _quarto.yml.\nHere is an example for a simple website. title: is the parameter to set the websiteʻs title. navbar: sets the menu, in this case on the left sidebar. By default tabs will be named based on the names of the .qmd files, but you can set them manually. There are many themes you can choose from too, check them out. For something different try cyborg.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"today\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: minty\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\nAgain, after saving your edits, quarto preview to see the effects. When you are satisfied with your website, quarto render to render to html.\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto render"

What are you aiming to get to?\n\nMethods - how did you do what you needed to do? Be sure to mention any new packages or tricky code you had to figure out. These often identify data manipulation steps that turn out to be critical.\nResults - what do the data show? What else did you find out?\nConclusions - what does it mean? What potential do you see here? If itʻs not finished, speculate on what you might be able to infer or what questions it might answer?\nWhat did you learn? What was most interesting, confusing, fun to figure out? Whatever you want to say\n\nSlides are optional, but can be helpful if you need a prompt to remember what to say. Or you can talk us through your writeup like I do in class, whatever is more comfortable for you. Do show us key elements like your repo, and how to access it, etc."

We will cover practical issues in data organization and management as well as programming in R and the tidyverse. Some of the topics will include: data ethics, best practices for coding and reproducible research, introduction to data visualizations, best practices for working with special data types (dates/times, text data, etc), best practices for storing data, basics of debugging, organizing and commenting code, basics of interacting with other computational resources from R. Topics in statistical data analysis, morphometrics, phylogenetic tree visualization, and other practical examples provide working examples."
