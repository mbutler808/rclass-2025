You can determine what version of R you have by starting up R and typing into the console R.version.string and hitting the return/enter key. If you do not have the proper version of R installed, go to CRAN and download and install the latest version.\nSome students like to use the Rstudio interface, but this is optional, and in fact discouraged until you have a grasp of the R environment (I will let you know when we are at a good place in the course). The RStudio interactive development environment (IDE) requires that R be installed, and so is an “add-on” to R. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop for free from the RStudio web site. You can determine the version of RStudio by looking at menu item Help &gt; About RStudio. You should be using RStudio version 1.4.1106 or higher."

Projects will be submitted electronically via GitHub (more on this later).\nThe projects are basically a scaffold to learn how to build a data analysis pipeline for your own research data. If you donʻt have your own data yet, I encourage students to ask their advisor for a sample dataset, or a published dataset, or another grad studentʻs dataset to practice on. You can also ask me for help to find data, this is not a problem.\nProject 0 is actually optional, but you are encouraged to practice by putting up your own website. Project 1 is data cleaning on a sample dataset, Project 2 produces analyses on the cleaned data from Project 1. Project 3 is applying everything you learned to your own dataset and exploring. You will also do a show-and-tell oral presentation on Project 3 at the end of the semester. Itʻs fun and students learn a lot. Itʻs exciting to see everyone elseʻs stuff and the diversity of projects people do.\nThe project assignments will be due on\n\nProject 0: February 4, 11:59pm (optional and not graded but hopefully useful and fun)\nProject 1: February 27, 11:59pm\nProject 2: March 25, 11:59pm\nProject 3: April 7-May 6 (multiple stages)\n\nCollaboration\nPlease feel free to study together and talk to one another about project assignments. The mutual instruction that students give each other is among the most valuable that can be achieved.\nHowever, it is expected that project assignments will be implemented and written up independently unless otherwise specified. Specifically, please do not share analytic code or output. Please do not collaborate on write-up and interpretation.

This is entirely left up to the discretion of the student.\nLate days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason no questions asked.\nYou do not get any bonus points for not using your late days, and they are not transferrable.\n\nFor students who exceed their free late days:\n\nI will be deducting 5% for each extra late day. For example, if you have already used all of your late days for the term, we will deduct 5% for the assignment that is &lt;24 hours late, 10% points for the assignment that is 24-48 hours late, and 15% points for the assignment that is 48-72 hours late, etc.\n\nI will not grade assignments that are more than 3 days past the original due date.\n\nRegrading Policy\nIt is very important to me that all assignments are properly graded. If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please send an email within 7 days of receiving the grade explaining the issue. No re-grade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 7 days after you receive the grade for the assignment."

    "text": "Prerequisites\nThis is an applied quantitative course. I will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking is useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R, especially at the very beginning (but it will get better). As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to do well, independent of your background. In fact you will have the most to gain.\nGetting set up\nYou must install R and RStudio, optional on your computer in order to complete this course. These are two different applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\nR is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\nRStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.\nThroughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the install.packages() function in R.

In the mac this is the XNU kernel, in modern Windows machines it is the Windows NT kernel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Source: Map of MacOS: the heart of everything is called Darwin; and within it, we have separate system utilities (the shell) and the XNU kernel, which is composed in parts by the Mach kernel and by the BSD kernel.]"

    "text": "The shell\nThe shell is another key part of the core operating system (note in the diagram above it is part of the System Utilities, and the partner of the kernel). The shell is a software (an app) that allows humans to control the computer. You are already familiar with the GUI interface, or the Graphical User Interface. It is important that you are comfortable using the Command Line Interface as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons to be proficient in the shell:\n\n\n\n\nData analysis increasingly uses many files. The shell provides a simple but very powerful means to do all kinds of operations on files: move, delete, organize, combine, rename, etc.\nUsing the shell encourages you to understand your computerʻs filesystem, and helps you to more precisely control input and output to any place along your file paths.\nShell operations are fast.\nYou can use wildcards to control matching or excluding many files.\nThe shell can be used to execute (run) software.\nThe shell is probably the oldest app, so it is very stable with lasting power.\nIt is part of the OS, so when your apps fail or you are having some issues, you would turn to the shell to kill troublesome processes (programs) or diagnose and fix the issues.\n\n\n\nMacs use the same terminal utilities as UNIX/Linux systems. On the Mac, the command line interface app is called Terminal, which you will find in your Application folder, in the Utilities subfolder (here is a screentshot of our GUI Interface).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a PC you would use the Command Prompt otherwise known as the Windows Command Processor or CMD. If you used a pre-Windows machine, you would be familiar with MS-DOS. To open CMD:\n\nOpen the Start Menu and type “command prompt” or\nPress Win + R and type “cmd” in the run box or\nPress Win + X and select Command Prompt from the menu.\n\nNote: you may see Windows PowerShell or Windows Terminal instead, these are similar apps."

What are you aiming to get to?\n\nMethods - how did you do what you needed to do? Be sure to mention any new packages or tricky code you had to figure out. These often identify data manipulation steps that turn out to be critical.\nResults - what do the data show? What else did you find out?\nConclusions - what does it mean? What potential do you see here? If itʻs not finished, speculate on what you might be able to infer or what questions it might answer?\nWhat did you learn? What was most interesting, confusing, fun to figure out? Whatever you want to say\n\nSlides are optional, but can be helpful if you need a prompt to remember what to say.
