</section><section id="introduction" class="level1"><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>From a young age, we have learned that scientific conclusions should be <strong>reproducible</strong>. After all, isnʻt that what the methods section is for? We are taught to write methods sections so that any scientist could, in theory, repeat the experiment with the idea that if the phenomenon is true, they should obtain comparable results and more often than not should come to the same conclusions.</p>
<p><em>But how repeatable is modern science?</em> Many experiments are now so complex and so expensive that repeating them is not practical. However, it is even worse than that. As datasets get larger and analyses become ever more complex, there is a growing concern that even given the data, we still cannot necessarily repeat the analysis. This is called <strong>“the reproducbility crisis”</strong>.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of discussion of reproducibility in the media and in the scientific literature. The journal <em>Science</em> had a special issue on reproducibility and data replication.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.science.org/toc/science/334/6060" class="uri">https://www.science.org/toc/science/334/6060</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Take for example a recent study by the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2203150119">Crowdsourced Replication Initiative (2022)</a>. It was a massive effort by 166 coauthors published in PNAS to test repeatability:</p>
<ul>
<li>73 research teams from around the world analyzed the <strong>same social science data</strong>.</li>
<li>They investigated the <strong>same hypothesis</strong>: that more immigration will reduce public support for government provision of social policies.</li>
<li>Together they fit 1261 statistical models and came to widely varying concluisons.</li>
<li>A meta-analysis of the results by the PIs could not explain the variation in results. Even after accounting for the choices made by the research teams in designing their statistical tests, 95% of the total variation remained unexplained.</li>
<li>The authors claim that “a hidden universe of uncertainty remains.”</li>

<p>This should be very disturbing. It was very disturbing to me! <a href="http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/repro-paper.pdf">Greyer</a> notes that the meta-analysis did not investigate how much of the variability of results was due to outright error. He furthermore notes that while the meta-analysis was done in a reproducibly, the original 73 analyses were not. What does he mean?</p>
</section><section id="some-of-the-issues-from-a-statisticianʻs-perspective" class="level1"><h1>Some of the issues from a statisticianʻs perspective</h1>
<p>Greyer provides nine ideas worth considering:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Most scientific papers that need statistics have conclusions that are not actually supported by the statistical calculations done, because of
<ol type="a">
<li>mathematical or computational error,</li>
<li>statistical procedures inappropriate for the data, or</li>
<li>statistical procedures that do not lead to the inferences claimed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Good computing practices — version control, well thought out testing, code reviews, literate programming — are essential to correct computing.</li>
<li>Failure to do all calculations from raw data to conclusions (every number or figure shown in a paper) in a way that is fully reproducible and available in a permanent public repository is, by itself, a questionable research practice.</li>
<li>Failure to do statistics as if it could have been pre-registered is a questionable research practice.</li>
<li>Journals that use P &lt; 0.05 as a criterion of publication are not scientific journals (publishing only one side of a story is as unscientific as it is possible to be).</li>
<li>Statistics should be adequately described, at least in the supplementary material.</li>
<li>Scientific papers whose conclusions depend on nontrivial statistics should have statistical referees, and those referees should be heeded.</li>
<li>Not all errors are describable by statistics. There is also what physicists call <em>systematic error</em> that is the same in every replication of an experiment. Physicists regularly attempt to quantify this. Others should too.</li>
</ol>
<p>A reasonable ideal for reproducible research today - Research should be reproducible. Anything in a scientific paper should be reproducible by the reader. - Whatever may have been the case in low tech days, this ideal has long gone. Much scientific research in recent years is too complicated and the published details to scanty for anyone to reproduce it. - The lack of detail is not entirely the author’s fault. Journals have severe page pressure and no room for full explanations. - For many years, the only hope of reproducibility is old-fashioned person-to-person contact. Write the authors, ask for data, code, whatever. Some authors help, some don’t. If the authors are not cooperative, tough. - Even cooperative authors may be unable to help. If too much time has gone by and their archiving was not systematic enough and if their software was unportable, there may be no way to recreate the analysis. - Fortunately, the internet comes to the rescue. No page pressure there! - Nowadays, many scientific papers also point to supplementary materials on the internet. Data, computer programs, whatever should be there, permanently. Ideally with a permanent Document Identifier or DOI. There are complaints that many Supplmentary Materials are incomprehensible, but that can be improved with practices of reproducible reserach.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the very least scientists should use in their statistical programming - version control, - software testing, - code reviews, - literate programming, and - all data and code available in a permanent public repository.</p>
<p>Some journals have specific policies to promote reproducibility in manuscripts that are published in their journals. For example, the Journal of American Statistical Association (JASA) requires authors to submit their code and data to reproduce their analyses and a set of Associate Editors of Reproducibility review those materials as part of the review process:</p>

<section id="authors-and-readers" class="level3"><h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="authors-and-readers">Authors and Readers</h3>
<p>It is important to realize that there are multiple players when you talk about reproducibility–there are different types of parties that have different types of interests. There are <strong>authors</strong> who produce research and they want to make their research reproducible. There are also <strong>readers</strong> of research and they want to reproduce that work. Everyone needs tools to make their lives easier.</p>
<p>One current <strong>challenge is that authors of research have to undergo considerable effort to make their results available to a wide audience</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing data and code today is not necessarily a trivial task. Although there are a number of resources available now, that were not available even five years ago, it is still a bit of a challenge to get things out on the web (or at least distributed widely).</li>
<li>Resources like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://kipoi.org">kipoi</a>, and <a href="http://rpubs.com">RPubs</a> and various data repositories have made a big difference, but there is still a ways to go with respect to building up the public reproducibility infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>even when data and code are available</strong>, readers often have to download the data, download the code, and then they have to piece everything together, usually by hand. It’s <strong>not always an easy task to put the data and code together</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Readers may not have the same computational resources that the original authors did.</li>
<li>If the original authors used an enormous computing cluster, for example, to do their analysis, the readers may not have that same enormous computing cluster at their disposal. It may be difficult for readers to reproduce the same results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the <strong>toolbox for doing reproducible research is small</strong>, although <strong>it’s definitely growing</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In practice, authors often just throw things up on the web. There are journals and supplementary materials, but they are famously disorganized.</li>
<li>There are only a few central databases that authors can take advantage of to post their data and make it available. So if you are working in a field that has a central database that everyone uses, that is great. If you are not, then you have to assemble your own resources.</li>

</section><section id="literate-programming" class="level1"><h1>Literate Programming</h1>
<p>Before there was widespread concern about “Reproducible Research”, the term <strong>literate programming</strong> was coined by <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Donald Knuth</a>, one of the true geniuses of computing, the author/inventor of TeX, and the notion of structured programming, among other things. He wrote a book about it in 1984!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, <em>addressed to human beings rather than to a computer</em>. The program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather like the World Wide Web. (Indeed, I used the word WEB for this purpose long before CERN grabbed it!) —<em>Donald Knuth</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs are useless without descriptions.</li>
<li>Descriptions should be literate, not comments in code or typical reference manuals.</li>
<li>The <em>code</em> in the descriptions <em>should work</em>. Thus it is necessary to extract the real working code from the literary description.</li>
</ul>
<p>These concepts were baked into the R help pages. You will see that there are working code examples for every single function in R at the bottom of each help page. In fact it is required before a package will be published on CRAN.</p>

<p>The basic issue is when you read a description of a data analysis, such as in an article or a technical report, for the most part, what you get is the report and nothing else.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone knows that behind the scenes <strong>there’s a lot that went into this article</strong> and that is what I call the <strong>data science pipeline</strong>.</p>

</div>
</section><section id="literate-programming-in-practice" class="level1"><h1>Literate Programming in Practice</h1>
<p>One basic idea to make writing reproducible reports easier is what’s known as <em>literate statistical programming</em>. The idea is to <strong>think of a report or a publication as a stream of text and code</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The text is readable by people and the code is readable by computers.</p></li>
<li><p>The analysis is described in a series of text and code chunks.</p></li>
<li><p>Each kind of code chunk will do something like load some data or compute some results.</p></li>
<li><p>Each text chunk will relay something in a human readable language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The code and text remain together</strong> in a single source document. No more separate analysis files and word processing files. When code is edited, the report is automatically generated and updated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There might also be <strong>presentation code</strong> that formats tables and figures and there’s article text that explains what’s going on around all this code. This stream of text and code is a literate statistical program or a literate statistical analysis.</p>
<section id="weaving-and-tangling" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weaving-and-tangling">Weaving and Tangling</h2>
<p>Literate programs by themselves are a bit difficult to work with, but they can be processed in two important ways.</p>
<p>Literate programs can be <strong>weaved</strong> to produce human readable documents like PDFs or HTML web pages, and they can <strong>tangled</strong> to produce machine-readable “documents”, or in other words, machine readable code.</p>
<p>In order to use a system like this you need a documentational language, that’s human readable, and you need a programming language that’s machine readable (or can be compiled/interpreted into something that’s machine readable).</p>
</section><section id="sweave" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sweave">Sweave</h2>
<p>One of the original literate programming systems in R that was designed to do this was called Sweave written by <a href="https://documents.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@commerce/documents/doc/uow012868.pdf">Friedrich Leisch</a>. Sweave enables users to combine R code with a documentation program called LaTeX. Sweave revolutionized coding, and has become part of the R base code. Leisch is on the R Core Development Team and the BioConductor Project.</p>
<p><strong>Sweave files ends a <code>.Rnw</code></strong> and have R code weaved through the document:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;plot1, height=4, width=5, eval=FALSE&gt;&gt;=
data(airquality)
plot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)
@</code></pre>
<p>Once you have created your <code>.Rnw</code> file, Sweave will process the file, executing the R chunks and replacing them with output as appropriate before creating the PDF document.</p>
<p>Sweaveʻs main limitation is that it requires knowledge of LaTeX</p>
<ul>
<li>LaTeX is very powerful for laying out mathematical equations and fine-tuned control of formatting, but is not a documentation language that is widely used outside of mathematics.</li>
<li>Therefore, there is a steep learning curve.</li>
<li>Sweave also <strong>lacks a lot of features that people find useful</strong> like caching, and multiple plots per page and mixing programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, folks have moved towards using something called <strong>knitr</strong>, which offers everything Sweave does, plus it extends it to much simpler Markdown documents.</p>
</section><section id="rmarkdown" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rmarkdown">rmarkdown</h2>
<p>Another choice for literate programming is to build documents based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> language. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension <code>.md</code>. The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown"><code>rmarkdown</code></a> R package takes a R Markdown file (<code>.Rmd</code>) and weaves together R code chunks Figure&nbsp;1, producing a large number of user-specified outputs.</p>

<p>“However, we have received comments from our readers and publisher that it would be beneficial to provide more practical and relatively short examples to show the interesting and useful usage of R Markdown, because it can be daunting to find out how to achieve a certain task from the aforementioned reference book (put another way, that book is too dry to read). As a result, this cookbook was born.”</p>

<p>Because this is lecture is built in a <code>.qmd</code> file (which is very similar to a <code>.Rmd</code> file), let’s demonstrate how this work. I am going to change <code>eval=FALSE</code> to <code>eval=TRUE</code>.</p>

<p>Before we leave this section, I find that there is quite a bit of terminology to understand the magic behind <code>rmarkdown</code> that can be confusing, so let’s break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>. Pandoc is a command line tool with no GUI that converts documents (e.g.&nbsp;from number of different markup formats to many other formats, such as .doc, .pdf etc). It is completely independent from R (but does come bundled with RStudio). If you donʻt have Rstudio installed, you will have to install <code>pandoc</code>.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> (<strong>markup language</strong>). Markdown is a lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension <code>.md.</code> It is completely independent from R.</li>
<li>R Markdown (<strong>markup language</strong>). R Markdown is an extension of the markdown syntax for weaving together text with R code. R Markdown files are plain text files that typically have the file extension <code>.Rmd</code>.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown"><code>rmarkdown</code></a> (<strong>R package</strong>). The R package <code>rmarkdown</code> is a library that uses pandoc to process and convert text and R code written in <code>.Rmd</code> files into a number of different formats. This core function is <code><a href="https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/render.html">rmarkdown::render()</a></code>. <strong>Note</strong>: this package only deals with the markdown language. If the input file is e.g.&nbsp;<code>.Rhtml</code> or <code>.Rnw</code>, then you need to use <code>knitr</code> prior to calling pandoc (see below).</li>

<section id="knitr" class="level3"><h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="knitr">knitr</h3>
<p>One of the alternative that has come up in recent times is something called <code>knitr</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>knitr</code> package for R takes a lot of these ideas of literate programming and updates and improves upon them.</li>
<li>
<code>knitr</code> still uses R as its programming language, but it allows you to mix other programming languages in.</li>
<li>You can also use a variety of documentation languages now, such as LaTeX, markdown and HTML.</li>
<li>
<code>knitr</code> was developed by Yihui Xie while he was a graduate student at Iowa State and it has become a very popular package for writing literate statistical programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knitr takes a plain text document with embedded code, executes the code and ‘knits’ the results back into the document.</p>
<p>For for example, it converts</p>
<ul>
<li>An R Markdown (<code>.Rmd)</code> file into a standard markdown file (<code>.md</code>)</li>
<li>An <code>.Rnw</code> (Sweave) file into to <code>.tex</code> format.</li>
<li>An <code>.Rhtml</code> file into to <code>.html</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core function is <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/knitr/man/knit.html">knitr::knit()</a></code> and by default this will look at the input document and try and guess what type it is e.g.&nbsp;<code>Rnw</code>, <code>Rmd</code> etc.</p>
<p>This core function performs three roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>source parser</strong>, which looks at the input document and detects which parts are code that the user wants to be evaluated.</li>
<li>A <strong>code evaluator</strong>, which evaluates this code</li>
<li>An <strong>output renderer</strong>, which writes the results of evaluation back to the document in a format which is interpretable by the raw output type. For instance, if the input file is an <code>.Rmd</code>, the output render marks up the output of code evaluation in <code>.md</code> format.</li>
</ul>

<p>As seen in the figure above, from there pandoc is used to convert e.g.&nbsp;a <code>.md</code> file into many other types of file formats into a <code>.html</code>, etc.</p>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).”</p>

</section></section></section><section id="in-comes-quarto" class="level1"><h1>In comes Quarto</h1>
<p>The folks who developed R Markdown have moved on to a new package called <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>. Quarto contains many of the features of R Markdown, but importantly, is now separate from Rstudio. It is intentionally developed as a cross-platform, cross-language markup language. It works with R, Python, Julia, and Observable. And is rapidly catching on with the statistical coding community.</p>
<p>Quarto can render output to many formats of documents including html, pdf, docx, md. It can also layout websites, presentations, or even books. It supports interactive apps such as Rshiny among other things.</p>
<p>We are going to learn using Quarto. Letʻs start by getting a simple webpage up. Conceptually, there are three tasks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create your quarto website on your computer</li>
<li>Make your website folder into a GitHub repo</li>
<li>Publish your website via GitHub</li>
</ol>
<section id="create-your-website-locally-with-quarto" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-your-website-locally-with-quarto">Create your website locally with Quarto</h2>
<p>In this section, I am adding a bit more explanation to the Quarto quickstart guide <em>up to and including Render</em>. If something is not clear, please consult <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/" class="uri">https://quarto.org/docs/websites/</a></p>
<p>There are three main quarto commands we will use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>quarto create-project</code>: Make a website project template</li>
<li>
<code>quarto preview</code>: Take a look at what the webite will look like</li>
<li>
<code>quarto render</code>: Render your <code>qmd</code> to <code>html</code>
</li>
</ul>
<section id="make-your-website-directory-and-template" class="level3"><h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-your-website-directory-and-template">Make your website directory and template</h3>
<p>Create your website (here called <code>mysite</code>) using the following command. It will make a directory of the same name and put the website contents within it.</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">

<p>The first section of your <code>index.qmd</code> is the header. You can change the title and add additional header information, including any cover images and website templates.</p>
<p>For example this is what I have in my course website <code>index.qmd</code> header.

<p>Try editing the <code>about.qmd</code> file as well. You will notice that this is another tab in your website. YOu can add more tabs by adding <code>.qmd</code> files.</p>
<p>With each addition, be sure to <code>quarto preview</code> your changes to make sure it works. When you are satisfied with your website, <code>quarto render</code> to render to html.</p>

<p><strong>Git</strong> is software that implements what is called a <em>version control system</em> for a repository of files (also known as a <em>repo</em>). The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the git software tracks, and records any changes made by anyone.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is an online server and user interface that provides powerful tools for distribution of your repository, bug tracking, collaboration, and also allows you to create easy websites for each repository.</p>
<p><strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong> together provide an organized way to track your projects, and all of the tools you will need in this course are free.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 1. Whether working solo (A) or collaborating in a group (B) version tracking by naming files is a mess when you want to retrace the steps of the analysis (C). Git and GitHub track all changes and the complete branching tree of the project (D). The commit history is a powerful tool to retrace the development of the project or can be used to roll back to any prior version.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It is very well suited for collaborative work, as it was developed by Linus Torvalds (in about 10 days of coding!) for collaborative software development of the Linux kernel <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds">pretty interesting interview with Torvalds</a>. What it did really well was <em>distributed control</em>, and allowing everyone to have their <em>own copy of the repository</em>.</p>
<p><em>Git</em>/<em>GitHub</em> is now the dominant version control system with <em>GitHub</em> hosting over 200 million repositories worldwide! It is used very broadly for all kinds of repos now including data science projects, book projects, courses, and anything that needs collaborative management of mostly text files.</p>
<p>Another great and fun read about Git/GitHub and why it is a great tool for data analysis is in this article by <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/">Jenny Bryan</a>.</p>
</section><section id="what-to-not-use-gitgithub-for" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-not-use-gitgithub-for">What to (not) use Git/GitHub for</h2>
<p><strong>GitHub is ideal if</strong> you have a project with (possibly many) smallish files, and most of those files are text files (such as R code, LaTeX, Quarto/(R)Markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub is less useful if</strong> you have a lot of non-text files (e.g.&nbsp;Word or PowerPoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub also has a problem with <em>large files</em></strong>. Anything above around 50MB can lead to very slow syncing and sometimes outright failure. Unfortunately, once GitHub has choked on a large file, it can be quite tricky to fix the repository to work again. <em>This is because the ENTIRE history is saved, including the addition of the huge file.</em> Therefore keep large (&gt;50MB) files out of your GitHub repositories. If you have to work with such files, try to reduce them first before placing into the GitHub repository. Or as alternative, place those files in another sync service (e.g.&nbsp;Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive) and load them from there.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, if you have <em>data</em></strong>, you need to be careful since by default, GitHub repositories are public. You can set the repository to private, but you need to be careful that you don’t accidentally expose confidential data to the public. It is in general not a good idea to have confidential data on GitHub. First anonymize your data (ensure that it is not at risk of identifiability), then you can place it in a private repository. If you put it in a public repo, be very careful!! (And you may need IRB approval, check with your institutional research office.)</p>

</section><section id="how-to-use-gitgithub" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-use-gitgithub">How to use Git/GitHub</h2>
<p>Git/GitHub is fundamentally <strong>based on commands you type into the command line</strong>. Lots of online resources show you how to use the command line. This is the most powerful, and the way I almost always interact with git/GitHub. However, many folks find this the most confusing way to use git/GitHub. Alternatively, there are graphical interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub itself</a> provides a grapical interface with basic functionality.</li>
<li>RStudio also has <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html">Git/GitHub integration</a>. Of course this only works for R project GitHub integration.</li>
<li>There are also third party GitHub clients with many advanced features, most of which you won’t need initially, but might eventually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As student, you can (and should) upgrade to the Pro version of GitHub for free (i.e.&nbsp;access to unlimited private repositories is one benefit), see the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub student developer pack</a> on how to do this.</p>
</section></section><section id="getting-started-with-git" class="level1"><h1>Getting Started with git</h1>
<p>One of my favorite resources for getting started with git/GitHub is the Happy Git with R from Jenny Bryan (especially for Rstudio users):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://happygitwithr.com" class="uri">https://happygitwithr.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is one of the <strong>most comprehensive resources</strong> out there for getting started with git/GitHub. I will encourage all of you to go read through the online book. Some of you may only need to skim it, others will need to spend some time reading through it. Either way, I hope you will agree it is a worthwhile investment to understand the basics as well as to know you can get help.</p>
<section id="sec-profile" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-profile">Set up your profile in git on your computer</h2>
<p>Before making changes to your repository, GitHub will want to verify your identity.</p>
<p>In order for your computer to talk to GitHub smoothly, you will need to set up your <strong>username</strong> and <strong>email</strong> in the <strong>git profile</strong> stored on your computer.</p>

</section><section id="sec-token" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-token">Set up your Personal Authentication Token on your computer</h2>
<p>GitHub will also want to check your credentials to authenticate you are really you before writing changes to your repo.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is the protocol for HTTP authentication. You will generate a <em>Personal Access Token</em> for HTTPS from your GitHub account which will be stored on your personal machine.</p>
<p>I prefer the GithHub command line interface or <code>gh</code> to do this. To install the CLI, follow <a href="https://github.com/cli/cli#installation">the instructions here for your operating system</a>. For Mac users, I suggest that you install <code>homebrew</code>, it is a command-line general software manager for many different software packages.</p>

<p>In this course, you will use git/GitHub in the following ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Project 0 (optional) - You will create a website introducing yourself to folks in the course and deploy it on GitHub.</li>
<li>Projects 1-3 - You can practice using git locally (on your compute environment) to track your changes over time and, if you wish (but highly suggested), you can practice pushing your project solutions to a private GitHub repository on your GitHub account (i.e.&nbsp;<code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, etc).</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning these skills will be useful down the road if you ever work collaboratively on a project (i.e.&nbsp;writing code with other people, or suggesting changes or bug fixes to other projects). In this scenario, you will use the skills you have been practicing in your projects to work together as a team in a single GitHub repository.</p>

<li>The nuclear option</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need to start over you can delete and remake your repos. (For example if you canʻt get your local and remote repos to communicate and you canʻt figure out why.)</p>
<p>Since your GitHub repo is empty and youʻre just getting started, there is really no harm in deleting it and starting over. From your repo on github.com, go to <code>settings</code>, then scrolll all the way down until you reach <code>The Danger Zone</code> where you will find the <code>Delete this repository</code> button.</p>
<p>If you just want to delete your local git tracking without deleting all of the files you created, you can just delete your local hidden <code>.git</code> directory, leaving the rest of the files and directories in place. From your command line:</p>

<p>Sooner or later, you will encounter a merge conflict. That happens if the same file(s) changed both locally and on GitHub.com. That can happen if multiple people work on the same files, or if you work on multiple computers and forget to always push/pull before and after you work on a project. Donʻt get discouraged, this is solvable!</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to do it manually. Moving the offending files out of your local repository, then doing the merge and after that adding the updates again can help. If you know that one source is the definite one, you can force a push or pull. A more advanced approach is to use branches.</p>

</section><section id="forking-a-repo" class="level1"><h1>Forking a repo</h1>
<p>When you want to build on someone elseʻs repo, that is a great time to <strong>fork</strong> a repo. This happens when you donʻt have write permission to the repo, but you want provide suggestions (for example if you want to fix a bug). Or if you want to use that repo as a template or a launching off point for your own project.</p>
<p>After you fork and clone the repo to your computer, you can edit, add, and commit the changes. When you are ready to submit the suggestions to the repo owner, start a <strong>pull request</strong>. They will then read over your suggested edits, and if they approve they can merge the changes into the working repo.</p>
<p><strong>Forks</strong> are nice because they remain connected to the parent repo in GitHub. So you can seamlessly work on your own private copy and send it back to the original project when you are ready.</p>
<p><strong>Branches</strong> work in a similar way. The idea is simple. If you have a working repo, you donʻt want to made edits or experimental changes to <strong>main</strong> that may break the functionality. Branches are a way to make a “development branch” where you can work on your ideas in private without breaking anything. When youʻre sure you have everything ironed out and working, you can merge your branch back to <strong>main</strong>, and delete your branch. They are meant to be an ephemeral scratch copy to keep the project clean, organized, and working perfectly.</p>

<p>The <em>kernel</em> is the part of your computerʻs operating system that loads first once you start up. It is kind of like your computerʻs autonomic nervous system. It recognizes all of the physical hardware attached to it, enables communication between components (and device drivers), and monitors maintenance functions like turning on the fan when it gets hot, manages virtual memory, gives warnings when the hard drive gets full, manages multitasking, and manages security and file permissions. In the mac this is the XNU kernel (“X is not UNIX”), in modern Windows machines it is the Windows NT kernel.</p>

<p>The <strong>shell</strong> is another key part of the core operating system (note in the diagram above it is part of the <strong>System Utilities</strong>, and the partner of the kernel). The shell is a software (an app) that allows humans to control the computer. You are already familiar with the <em>GUI</em> interface, or the <em>Graphical User Interface</em>. It is important that you are comfortable using the <em>Command Line Interface</em> as well.</p>

There are many reasons to be proficient in the shell:
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ul>
<li>Data analysis increasingly uses many files. The shell provides a simple but very powerful means to do all kinds of operations on files: move, delete, organize, combine, rename, etc.</li>
<li>Using the shell encourages you to understand your computerʻs filesystem, and helps you to more precisely control input and output to any place along your file paths.</li>
<li>Shell operations are fast.</li>
<li>You can use wildcards to control matching or excluding many files.</li>
<li>The shell can be used to execute (run) software.</li>
<li>The shell is probably the oldest app, so it is very stable with lasting power.</li>
<li>It is part of the OS, so when your apps fail or you are having some issues, you would turn to the shell to kill troublesome processes (programs) or diagnose and fix the issues.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Macs use the same terminal utilities as UNIX/Linux systems. On the Mac, the command line interface app is called <em>Terminal</em>, which you will find in your <em>Application</em> folder, in the <em>Utilities</em> subfolder (here is a screentshot of our GUI Interface).</p>

<p>On a PC if you installed <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/install-git">Git For Windows</a>, you can use <em>Git-Bash</em> (a UNIX emulator) and follow the UNIX instructions (this would be my personal preference). Otherwise you use the <em>Command Prompt</em> also known as the <em>Windows Command Processor</em> or <em>CMD</em>. If you used a pre-Windows machine, you would be familiar with MS-DOS. To open CMD:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the Start Menu and type “command prompt” or</li>
<li>Press <strong>Win + R</strong> and type “cmd” in the run box or</li>
<li>Press <strong>Win + X</strong> and select Command Prompt from the menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: you may see <em>Windows PowerShell</em> or <em>Windows Terminal</em> instead, these are similar apps.</p>
</section></section><section id="the-working-directory" class="level1"><h1>The Working Directory</h1>
<p>By default, the working directory on a Mac and UNIX/Linux systems is your home user directory “~”. On a PC the default working directory may look something like a subdirectory of your C drive “C:[Username]".</p>
<p>This is where you currently are in your computerʻs file structure.</p>
<p>First, let’s check where we are by listing the files in our current directory. Note that some shell commands differ between different shells (i.e.&nbsp;UNIX vs.&nbsp;PC). Listing the contents of a directory is done with <strong>ls</strong> in UNIX and <strong>dir</strong> in PC:</p>

<p>You have now created the Rclass directory, changed directory again into Rclass, and listed files. (It should be empty.)</p>
<p>This seems like a lot of trouble, when you can just point and click in the GUI. But the beauty of the shell is its power. We can automate actions, execute code, and use wildcards to do many at once (coming up below).</p>
<p>Letʻs say you wanted to create files in a new subfolder. <strong>touch</strong> is a command that creates a new (empty) file, or alters the timestamp of existing files.</p>

<p>Donʻt get confused! “C:" drive is not the”OneDrive”. (the OneDrive is a location on your hard drive, sometimes on C:, sometimes on D:) Windows makes use of a lot of symbolic links to make it easier for the user. These are different directories, sometims on different drives or partitions, but to the user it looks like theyʻre in the same folder). Symbolic links can be generally used in filepaths, but it can be very confusing if you accidentally end up with a circular reference or when you need to find the actual location on the hard drive.</p>
<p>Use the “\ad” flag with <strong>dir</strong> to see all of the symbolic links too. They call these symbolic links <em>namespace junctions</em>.</p>

<p>You can use these as shortcuts as starting points for your path to basically write an absolute path. This becomes important when you write a script that may be moved to different locations or shared with different people on different computers.</p>
<p>For example, “cd ~/Documents” will take you to the Documents folder inside your user directory, regardless of where you are currently because it is an <strong>absolute path</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>relative path</strong> will traverse the file directory <em>relative</em> to where you are currently. For example “Documents” will start at current working directory and look for a subfolder called Documents:</p>
