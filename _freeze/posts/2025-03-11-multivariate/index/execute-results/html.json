After we have gone through the task of making bivariate plots, checking for errors in the data, and finalizing the raw data, it is time to start looking for patterns and exploring. \n\n\n# Data transformation\n\nThe first step you will often think about is do you have to log-transform your data? Or do some other transformation? You may need to, for example, if you are doing morphometrics and have a lot of size variation. \n\nThere are several reasons why you might need to do a transformation:\n\n## Nature of the relationship among variables\n\nYou may also expect your data to follow a power law, in which case a log-transformation will __make the data linear__. For example, things that scale with body size tend to have the form:\n\n$$\nY = aMass^b  \n$$\n$$\nlog(Y) = log(a) + b\\times log(Mass)\n$$\n\n\n## Fitting assumptions of parametric statistics\n\nIf you plan to do parametric statistics, for example many forms of regression, ANOVA, etc. one of the major assumptions is that the __errors__ are __normally distributed__. \n\nThat is, the relationship follows the form:\n\n$$\nY \\sim X + e\n$$\n\nWhich is read as __Y__ is proportional to __X__ plus random error. Where `e ~ N` or the errors or deviations from this relationship follow a normal distribution.   Note that this assumes that X is known without error. \n\n### Checking for normality \n\nA convenient tool for checking the normality of continuous data is `qqnorm()` which plots the QQ quantiles of the data. If it is normally distributed, the points should fall on a straight line:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqqnorm(iris$Sepal.Length)\nqqline(iris$Sepal.Length)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOr the `ggplot2` version:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(ggplot2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(magrittr)  # for piping using %>%\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: magrittr\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(iris, aes(sample=Sepal.Length)) + \n  stat_qq() +\n  stat_qq_line()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis data looks pretty good, except for some deviations along the edges. Most data will not ever be perfectly normal, you will get a sense of what is acceptable with more experience.\n\nHowever, we do know that this data contains three species -- what happens if you were to look at the data by species? \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niris %>% \n    ggplot( aes(sample=Sepal.Length)) + \n   stat_qq( aes(col=Species)) +\n   stat_qq_line( aes(col=Species) )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Skew\n\nDeviations from normality are not the end of the world, and often a little is tolerated. What can be more problematic is strong skew. For that you will really want to transform the data:\n\n![](../../images/skew.gif)\n[Source](https://medium.com/@TheDataGyan/day-8-data-transformation-skewness-normalization-and-much-more-4c144d370e55)\n\nRight skewed data is data with a long tail to the right (the positive side). Left skeweed data has along tail to the left. Here are a few methods. There are more\n\n| Skew | Transform | Code |\n|------|:----------|:-----|\n|strong right | cube root | `z = x^(1/3)` |\n|             | square root | `z = x6(1/2)` |\n|             | log | `z = log(x)` |\n|             |  | `z = log10(x)` |\n|             |  | `z = log2(x)` |\n|strong left | square | `z = x^2` |\n\n\n\n## Separating Size and Shape\n\n\nWill you want to do an analysis of the data along with a size-corrected dataset? If shape variation is interesting for your data (i.e., do they differ in shape when we control for differences in size, or are they _relatively_ larger or smaller?), then you may want to find some sort of size-adjustment. Popular methods include  \n\n-  Regressing against a size variable, and using residuals  \n-  PCA analysis excluding PC1 (PC1 is considered size),  \n-  Shear or Procrustes methods, and  \n-  Ratios with size.  \nThere is a huge wealth of literature on size and how to analyze shape. \n\n\n\n\n# Principal Components Analysis\n\nNow you are ready to begin. Often we have many variables measured and we suspect that many of the variables are collinear (or correlated) so that many of them contain the same or similar information. To summarize the variation, we may want to do a Principal Components Analysis.\n\nPCA is an ordination method that is useful to explore patterns of variation in the data. When variables are correlated (or non-independent), PCA finds linear combinations of the original data that summarize _most_ of the variation. It is therefore very useful for reducing the number of variables to a few most important axes of variation. \n\nIt produces a number of Principal Component axes (the same number as the number of original variables). The first PC axis is along the direction of greatest variation in the data. The second PC  axis is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the first, and in the direction of the next greatest source of variation in the data. The third is orthogonal to the first and second, etc. and so on. Because all of the axes are orthogonal to one another, they summarize independent variation. \n\n## PCA Loadings\n\nSome things to look for in PC analysis: The __loadings__ of the variables on the PC axes show _how much each variable is correlated with that PC axis_. The magnitude of the loading indicates how strong the correlation is, and the sign indicates the _direction_.  The sign of the loading is only informative if variables load with different signs on the same PC axis. For example if variable A and B load positively with PC 2, and variable C loads negatively, this is often interpreted as varying along PC2 in an increasing direction indicating larger A and B but smaller C.  In a morphological analysis, the first PC axis often loads positively and nearly equally on all variables, and is therefore considered to indicate size.  PC1 also typically explains a large fraction of the variation. \n\n\nThe amount of variation each PC axis explains is called the __proportion of variance explained__. It is usually expressed as a percent or a fraction. It is not uncommon in morphological analysis for PC1 to explain 90% of the variation in the data. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that the amount of variation does not necessarily indicate it's __importance__. Many ecological associations or functionally significant variation is reflected in shape variation, which as we said may be only 10% of the variation. However, this might be very functionally relevant. Size may vary a lot, but it might be whether or not you have very long legs relative to your size that tells us if you are a good runner. Long legs (in an absolute sense) may not make you a great runner if you are actually huge in size, so that relative to your body length, your legs are actually relatively short. So one thing to keep in mind is that you often will use only 3 axes, even though you have 10 or more variables. If you have managed to capture 90 or 95\\% of the variation with the first three variables (sometimes even more), you're probably in great shape. It's a tradeoff between keeping the analysis and interpretation manageable, and keeping all the variation in the data. Usually the minor axes have less than 1% of the variation, and are usually not interesting even if you were to keep them. Anyway, to conclude this paragraph, you may want to do a PC analysis on the data with size included, and then do a second analysis on the size-adjusted data (shape). Another strategy is to do a PC analysis on the data with size, and then leave out PC1 in downstream analyses of \"shape\".\n\n\n# Example Fisher ªs Iris data\n\n\nLet's do a PC analysis on Fisher's Iris data, which is a famous multivariate dataset build into R. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(iris)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are:\n-  Four measurements of sepal and petal length and width \n-  Three species of iris\n-  Fifty individuals are measured for each iris species. \n\nPC analysis in R uses the `princomp` function. You can either specify the columns of the data to do a PC analysis, or use the formula representation (with no response variables since it is not a regression). A tilde with a dot indicates all variables, and you can exclude columns with a minus sign as usual.  You should only put continuous variables into a PC analysis. So in the iris data, we can exclude species with the minus sign:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npc.iris <- princomp (~ .-Species, data=iris, scores=T)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe see the first two PC axes explain more than 97\\% of the variation, with PC1 explaining 92\\%, and PC2 5\\%. Because there are four original variables, we have two more PC axes but they only explain 1.7\\% and 0.5\\% of the variation and we will ignore them. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(pc.iris)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nImportance of components:\n                          Comp.1     Comp.2     Comp.3      Comp.4\nStandard deviation     2.0494032 0.49097143 0.27872586 0.153870700\nProportion of Variance 0.9246187 0.05306648 0.01710261 0.005212184\nCumulative Proportion  0.9246187 0.97768521 0.99478782 1.000000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can see how the PC axes reflect the original variables by using the loadings accessor function:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nloadings(pc.iris)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nLoadings:\n             Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4\nSepal.Length  0.361  0.657  0.582  0.315\nSepal.Width          0.730 -0.598 -0.320\nPetal.Length  0.857 -0.173        -0.480\nPetal.Width   0.358        -0.546  0.754\n\n               Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4\nSS loadings      1.00   1.00   1.00   1.00\nProportion Var   0.25   0.25   0.25   0.25\nCumulative Var   0.25   0.50   0.75   1.00\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nPC1 reflects variation primarily in petal length as evidenced by it's high correlation (__0.857__), and to a lesser extent by sepal length and petal width. PC2 indicates variation in sepal width, as well as additional variation in sepal length. Petal length loads in the opposite direction and thus would decrease as sepal length and width increased, but the correlation value is rather low (__0.173__). PC3 actually shows a trade-off between sepal length and both sepal width and petal width (with all loadings having similar magnitudes), but it explains very little of the overall variation.\n\nThe scores are the values of each datapoint along the PC axes in PC space.

PC1 seems to contribute the most to separating the species, whereas PC2 seems to reflect variation within species. \n\nOne important point to note is that the axes should be scaled to match each other. One unit on the X axis should occupy the same length of graph as one unit on the Y axis, otherwise the plot will be visually deceptive with regard to how much variation each axis has. Here is how we should scale the Y-axis in order to match the X-axis. Now you can see what the meaning of 97% of the variation being along PC1 is!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(pc2 ~ pc1, col=iris$Species, cex=2, pch=16, ylim=c(-3, 4))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhat about PC3?

I should find another example!\n\nNote: You should decide whether to do PCA using covariance matrices or correlation matrices. The default in R is covariance matrices, and this will preserve the original scale of the data.  If we use correlation matrices, then each variable is allowed to contribute equally, irrespective of how wide the range of values within each variable (it's like they're all standardized first). So you should only use covariances when all measurements are in the same units, for example all lengths in same units, and it makes sense to relate the magnitude of variation in one to another. Otherwise use correlation matrices. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npc.iris.cor <- princomp (~ .-Species, data=iris, scores=T, cor=T)\nsummary(pc.iris.cor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nImportance of components:\n                          Comp.1    Comp.2     Comp.3      Comp.4\nStandard deviation     1.7083611 0.9560494 0.38308860 0.143926497\nProportion of Variance 0.7296245 0.2285076 0.03668922 0.005178709\nCumulative Proportion  0.7296245 0.9581321 0.99482129 1.000000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nloadings(pc.iris.cor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nLoadings:\n             Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4\nSepal.Length  0.521  0.377  0.720  0.261\nSepal.Width  -0.269  0.923 -0.244 -0.124\nPetal.Length  0.580        -0.142 -0.801\nPetal.Width   0.565        -0.634  0.524\n\n               Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4\nSS loadings      1.00   1.00   1.00   1.00\nProportion Var   0.25   0.25   0.25   0.25\nCumulative Var   0.25   0.50   0.75   1.00\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can see that the picture we get is a little different. Now that we use correlation matrices, the dominance of the lengths are reduced (the petals and sepals are much more variable in length than in width). You should go through the analysis yourself. \n\n# Canonical Discriminant Analysis\n\nThe PCA does not at all account for group structure. When we have multiple groups, we sometimes want to control for within-group structure. One reason is that if we adjust for within-group structure, the groups will be better separated. Another is that the directions of within-group differences might be slightly different than the between-group differences, and we don't want to blend them together because they have different biological meanings. (In this view, the within-group variance is usually the less-interesting portion, and we really are interested in studying the between-group variance). \n\nAnother reason to do canonical discriminant analysis is to obtain scores as in PCA to do further analysis. It just produces scores accounting for group structure, so it is like a multi-group PCA. For example, I used this technique to produce a multivariate multi-group ordination in my studies of sexual dimorphism amongst multiple species. I allowed each species and sex to be a different group, and then tested to see if ecomorphs clustered together. \n\nTo do this analysis, you need to install the package `candisc`, and any dependencies. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Mac Users!!! (PC users can ignore, I think)\n\n`rgl` which is a package that produces a graphical device driver that `candisc` depends on, needs an x11 window (for Mac this is `Xquartz`). You must install it from it ªs own website: \n\n<https://www.xquartz.org>\n\nThen install `candisc`, and it should work\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"candisc\", dependencies=T)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe then produce a multivariate model as in the manova example above. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(candisc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: candisc\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: heplots\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: broom\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'candisc'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    cancor\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niris.multiv <- lm( cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) ~ Species, data=iris )\niris.can <- candisc( iris.multiv, term=\"Species\")\niris.can\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCanonical Discriminant Analysis for Species:\n\n   CanRsq Eigenvalue Difference  Percent Cumulative\n1 0.96987   32.19193     31.907 99.12126     99.121\n2 0.22203    0.28539     31.907  0.87874    100.000\n\nTest of H0: The canonical correlations in the \ncurrent row and all that follow are zero\n\n  LR test stat approx F numDF denDF   Pr(> F)    \n1      0.02344  199.145     8   288 < 2.2e-16 ***\n2      0.77797   13.794     3   145 5.794e-08 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(iris.can, col=as.numeric(iris$Species))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nVector scale factor set to 7.122\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSo you can see that by accounting for within-species variation, we get better separation of species. Again, we see the greatest separation along Can1. But interestingly, we see that three of the variables are contributing the most to Can1 (but all are highly correlated). \n\nYou can see the loadings on the original variables, as well as the percent variance explained using the following code:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niris.can$structure\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                   Can1       Can2\nSepal.Length -0.7918878 0.21759312\nSepal.Width   0.5307590 0.75798931\nPetal.Length -0.9849513 0.04603709\nPetal.Width  -0.9728120 0.22290236\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niris.can$eigenvalues\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  3.219193e+01  2.853910e-01  7.746927e-16 -1.104367e-15\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niris.can$pct\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  9.912126e+01  8.787395e-01  2.385334e-15 -3.400425e-15\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n__Ninetly-nine percent of the variance__ is explained by __Can1__, which is itself dominated by Petal length and width (__.98__ and __.97__), and also with a  strong contribution by sepal length (__.79__). Sepal width provides a contribution in the opposite direction but its correlation value is less (-0.53). We can get most of the separation between species along simply Can1.  The scores of each individual in Can space is given in `iris.can`\n",
