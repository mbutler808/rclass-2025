One of the most tedious tasks of science is hand-editing bibiolographies --- and one of the great benefits of the LaTeX environment is the automated *formatting references for bibliographies*. üéä\n\nIt ªs worth taking a little time to learn how to use these tools, as citations are critical for every paper, project report, or academic website, and is often even required in paper assignments. Since R markdown and Quarto work nicely with LaTeX (and BibTeX, the associated reference management software), we get a bonus in having access to the power of BibTeX without writing any LaTeX, maing it easy to add citations to our Quarto markdown projects.\n\nQuarto documentation currently doesn ªt include citations, but seems to support all the features presnt in R markdown. We will be using `.bib` format references in this tutorial, but R markdown (and presumably Quarto) supports other citation formats as well ([for more info see](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)).\n\n\n## The Parts\n\nThere are three basic parts:\n\n1.  The citation data which is stored in the `.bib` file @sec-bib, and\n2.  In-text citations added by the author into the `.qmd` document @sec-inline, and\n3.  Linking the  ª.bib ª file in the `YAML` header @sec-linking.\n\nFrom this, both the *in-text citations* as well as the *citation list* at the end of the document will be rendered.\n\nThere are additional customization options. You can change the *style* of the bibliography using style and class files @sec-style. This is at the level of the entire document, it is easy to switch. Within the document, there are also many options for in-text citation styles @sec-options.  You can also customize the style file by editing the LaTeX.\n\n*Reference managers* are helper software (independent of BibTeX) that are wonderful tools to help you collect and organize your citation data @sec-manager.\n\n\n# The Bibliography is in `.bib` files {#sec-bib}\n\nThe citation data are stored in a `.bib` file which is a text file. Most people don ªt type these entries themselves (unless it ªs for a new publication!) but rather download these through journal databases such as *Web of Science*, *PubMed*, directly from jornal websites, etc.\n\nR provides nice function `citation()` that generating the citation blob for R packages. Let's try generating citation text for the R environment by using the following command\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation(\"base\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2024). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical\n  Computing_. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  <https://www.R-project.org/>.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2024},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis. See also 'citation(\"pkgname\")' for\nciting R packages.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can replace \"base\" with any R package name, such as \"rmarkdown\" or my package \"ouch\".\nYou can see that the format is simple, the information is in a key = value format, and the various parts have tags.\n\nMultiple citations are stored in your `.bib` file, with each citation separated by a blank line.\n\n# Reference Managers {#sec-manager}\n\nPersonally, I really like [BibDesk]<https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io> for Mac OS to manage my citations.  It  is easy to use and has all the features I need. A cross-platform option that is popular now is JabRef <https://github.com/JabRef/jabref>. [JabRef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef) is written in Java, is open source and has support for Linux, Windows, and MacOS.\n\n## Citation management software\n\nIn addition to `.bib` (BibTeX) there are a lot of file formats in use including `.medline` (MEDLINE), `.ris` (RIS), and `.enl` (EndNote), among others. You can generally download the results of your literature search in the format of your choice (some citation manager software can convert formats as well).\n\nIf you recall the output from `citation(\"rmarkdown\")` above, one option is to copy and paste the BibTeX output into a text file labeled `.bib` or into citation management software, but instead we can use R ªs `write_bib()` function from the `knitr` package to create a bibliography file.\n\nLet's run the following code in order to generate a `my-refs.bib` file\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::write_bib(\"rmarkdown\", file = \"my-refs.bib\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can output multiple citations by passing a vector of package names:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::write_bib(c(\"rmarkdown\",\"base\"), file = \"my-refs.bib\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow we can see we have the file saved locally.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist.files()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"ButlerPapers.bib\" \"evolution.csl\"    \"index.qmd\"        \"index.rmarkdown\" \n[5] \"my-refs.bib\"     \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf you open up the `my-refs.bib` file, you will see\n\n    @Manual{R-base,\n      title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n      author = {{R Core Team}},\n      organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n      address = {Vienna, Austria},\n      year = {2022},\n      url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n    }\n\n    @Manual{R-rmarkdown,\n      title = {rmarkdown: Dynamic Documents for R},\n      author = {JJ Allaire and Yihui Xie and Jonathan McPherson and Javier Luraschi and Kevin Ushey and Aron Atkins and Hadley Wickham and Joe Cheng and Winston Chang and Richard Iannone},\n      year = {2021},\n      note = {R package version 2.8},\n      url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown},\n    }\n\n    @Book{rmarkdown2018,\n      title = {R Markdown: The Definitive Guide},\n      author = {Yihui Xie and J.J. Allaire and Garrett Grolemund},\n      publisher = {Chapman and Hall/CRC},\n      address = {Boca Raton, Florida},\n      year = {2018},\n      note = {ISBN 9781138359338},\n      url = {https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown},\n    }\n\n    @Book{rmarkdown2020,\n      title = {R Markdown Cookbook},\n      author = {Yihui Xie and Christophe Dervieux and Emily Riederer},\n      publisher = {Chapman and Hall/CRC},\n      address = {Boca Raton, Florida},\n      year = {2020},\n      note = {ISBN 9780367563837},\n      url = {https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook},\n    }\n\n::: resources\n**Note there are three keys that we will use later on**:\n\n-   `R-rmarkdown`\n-   `rmarkdown2018`\n-   `rmarkdown2020`\n:::\n\n# Linking `.bib` file with `.rmd` or `.qmd` files {#sec-linking}\n\nIn order to use references within a R Markdown file, you will need to specify the name and a location of a bibliography file using the bibliography metadata field in a YAML metadata section. For example:\n\n``` yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My top ten favorite R packages\"\noutput: html_document\nbibliography: my-refs.bib\n---\n```\n\nYou can include multiple reference files using the following syntax, alternatively you can concatenate two bib files into one.\n\n``` yaml\n---\nbibliography: [\"my-refs1.bib\", \"my-refs2.bib\"]\n---\n```\n\n# Inline citation {#sec-inline}\n\nNow we can start using those bib keys that we have learned just before, using the following syntax\n\n-   `[@key]` for single citation\n-   `[@key1; @key2]` multiple citation can be separated by semi-colon\n-   `[-@key]` in order to suppress author name, and just display the year\n-   `[see @key1 p 12; also this ref @key2]` is also a valid syntax\n\nLet's start by citing the `rmarkdown` package using the following code and press `Knit` button:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have been using the amazing Rmarkdown package [@R-rmarkdown]! These look like great books to read [@rmarkdown2018; and @rmarkdown2020].\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPretty cool, huh??\n\n# Citation styles {#sec-style}\n\nBy default, Pandoc will use a Chicago author-date format for citations and references.\n\nTo use another style, for example, in ecology and evolution, we often use the `evolution.csl` style. You will need to specify a CSL (Citation Style Language) file in the `csl` metadata field, e.g.,\n\n``` yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My top ten favorite R packages\"\noutput: html_document\nbibliography: my-refs.bib\ncsl: biomed-central.csl\n---\n```\n\n::: callout-note\n### Resources\nThe [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles) makes it easy to search for and download your desired style. Just include it in the same directory as with your `.qmd` file.\n:::\n\nCSL files also can be tweaked to meet custom formatting requirements. For example, we can change the number of authors required before \"et al.\" is used to abbreviate them. This can be simplified through the use of visual editors such as the one available at <https://editor.citationstyles.org>.\n\n# Other cool features {#sec-options}\n\n#### Add an item to a bibliography without using it\n\nBy default, the bibliography will only display items that are directly referenced in the document. If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there. They will be included in the references cited at the end, even though there is no in-text citation.\n\n``` yaml\n---\nnocite: |\n  @item1, @item2\n---\n```\n\n#### Add all items to the bibliography\n\nIf we do not wish to explicitly state all of the items within the bibliography but would still like to show them in our references, we can use the following syntax:\n\n``` yaml\n---\nnocite: '@*'\n---\n```\n\nThis will force all items to be displayed in the bibliography.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Resources\nYou can also have an appendix appear after bibliography. For more on this, see:\n\n-   <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html>\n:::\n\n# A Comment\n\nWe have learned that within your bibliography file (e.g. `my-refs.bib`), each reference gets a key, which is a shorthand that is generated by the reference manager or by yourself.\n\nFor instance, I use a format of `author:year` for example `Butler:2023` because it ªs easy for me to remember the literature that I want to cite that way. It makes it easier to write the content.\n\nWhen there are multiple citations in a year by the same author last name, my BibDesk software adds two unique letters after the year (I usually manually change it to one letter, i.e., `Butler:2023a`) so that each citation has a unique key.\n\nYou can choose any format you wish, just pick one and use it *forever*.  As you write more papers, you can easily copy citations into your different bibliographies.  You are building a database that is *reusable*. \n\nIn your R Markdown document, you can then cite the reference by adding the key, such as `...in the paper by Butler et al. [@Butler:2022]...`.\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Practice\n\nHere are some post-lecture tasks to practice some of the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n**Try out the following:**\n\n1.  What do you notice that's different when you run `citation(\"tidyverse\")` (compared to `citation(\"rmarkdown\")`)?\n\n2.  Install the following packages:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"bibtex\", \"RefManageR\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat do they do? How might they be helpful to you in terms of reference management?\n\n3.  Practice using a different CSL file to change the citation style.\n:::\n",
