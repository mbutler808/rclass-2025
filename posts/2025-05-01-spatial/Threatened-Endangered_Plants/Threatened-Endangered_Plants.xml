            <abstract>[Metadata]  Description:  Threatened and Endangered Plants as of 1992Source: State of Hawaii, Department of Land and Natural Resouces, Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW).There is one T&amp;amp;E coverage for each island.  Each
 island is divided into distinct zones of T&amp;amp;E species concentration,
 ranging from 'low' concentration to 'very high' concentration of 
T&amp;amp;E plant species.  It should be noted, however, that for these 
particular coverages,concentration does not necessarily reflect the 
rareness of a particular plant species.  In other words, an area 
designated as having a 'low' concentration of T&amp;amp;E species may 
include the last known occurrence of a particular plant species.All island coverages were digitized from Division of Forestry and Wildlife's mylar threatened and endangered (T&amp;amp;E) plant species maps.   The maps were all at a scale of 1:62,500 except Hawaii, which was at a scale of 1:250,000.  DOFAW's maps were created using The Nature Conservancy's Rare &amp;amp; Endangered Species maps.May 2024:  Hawaii Statewide GIS Program staff removed extraneous fields 
that had been added as part of the 2016 GIS database conversion and were
 no longer needed.For additional information, please refer to complete metadata at https://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/op/gis/data/teplant.pdf or contact Hawaii Statewide GIS Program, Office of Planning and Sustainable Development, State of Hawaii; PO Box 2359, Honolulu, HI 96804; (808) 587-2846; email: gis@hawaii.gov; Website: https://planning.hawaii.gov/gis.</abstract>
