## The Modern Computationally-Literate Scientist

::: {.incremental .scrollable}

- Uses computational tools to test ideas
- Has Computing Skills to:
  + Handle any kind of data
  + Implement any kind of test
  + Produce graphics for exploration and communication
  + Test and validate code (how do we know its right?)
  + Interact with other computing systems and the Cloud
  + Can archive and disseminate data and workflow
  + Produce reproducible results!

## Data Science Workflow
#### From [R for Data Science 2e](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickam, Garrett Grolemund, and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel
[![](../../images/whole-game.png){fig-alt="R for Data Science"}](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/whole-game.html)

::: {.incremental}

- Question Development 
- Exploration and Testing 
- Communication

:::

## Our Work is Interdisciplinary

::: {.incremental}

- Disciplinary Knowledge (Biology) -> Question Development 
- Statistics -> Exploration and Testing 
- Computer Science -> Repeatable, Scalable, Reusable 
  + __Code MUST be FREE OF ERROR__
  + Clean and Well documented (understandable)
  + Modular - enhances _creativity_ and _scalability_

:::

## Data Science Workflow Requirements:

The difference between analyzing data for an assignment (Undergraduate work) vs. professional science (publication)

::: {.incremental}

- The "answer" must be correct - code __validation__
- Must be __repeatable__
- Workflow must be complete, well organized, __documented__
- Data and code shared on a public repository with a DOI 
  + e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) (free options!) 
  + or [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) ($150 per dataset)

## Open Source Tools you will learn in this course
::: {.incremental}
- R \[[watch short podcast, up to 4:00](https://youtu.be/wzPRpyoNaa8?si=TxENkAoxZ_D8kHcJ)\]
- Command Line (UNIX/ Windows/ File Commands in your operating system)
  + Understand your computer's organization and filepaths
  + More precisely control your files and information
  + Install some command-line software
- Git/GitHub
- Quarto/Rmarkdown
- and many more...

## How the Tools Fit Together 
[![](../../images/whole-game.png){fig-alt="R for Data Science"}](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/whole-game.html)

::: {.nonincremental}

| Need | Tools |
|------|-------|
| Observe -> Record Data -> Data Table  | *Notebooks* |
| Code -> Document -> Comment (annotate) | *R* |
| Organize Project -> Version Control -> Share | *Git/GitHub* |
| Communicate |  *Quarto/Rmarkdown* |

:::

## Software

- Do you have R installed and working? (R studio is optional)
- For a longer walk-through here is another resource: [Introduction to R/Rstudio](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatcomputing2022/posts/2022-08-30-introduction-to-r-and-rstudio/)
- Git/GitHub: Please Install for next time. Letʻs follow [Introduction to Git/GitHub](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatcomputing2022/posts/2022-08-30-introduction-to-gitgithub/)

## Learning R - A first session

::: {.incremental}
- Think about how R works as you try out commands
- "Mistakes" are opportunities to learn how R works!
- Learning Language involves a lot of trial and error
- Don't be afraid to try - poke it - it won't break!
- <https://www.r-project.org>  Go to manuals, click on **An Introduction to R**
- Follow Section 2.1
- input -> R -> output
- What came out? What does it tell you about the rules R follows?
- Computers only do **Exactly** what you tell them to do
- Jump to Appendix A - letʻs try to understand some rules of R together
